### Setup
First, you'll need a Postgres database to connect to. Follow instructions here to setup the database and save credentials for the next step.

Next create a `.env` file at the root directory. It will need to contain the following environment variables (change the values for the database to match what you defined in the previous step)
```
PORT=5000
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=database
```
